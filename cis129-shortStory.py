#This is my first python lab in my cis129 course it explains why the file name is slightly incorrect
#deleted Hello World! script and added the story

print('I have two small dogs named Lucky and Lukey')
print('They are both less than a year old so they're pretty rambunctious')
print('They still chew on things they are not supposed to chew on, like pillows, cushions, paper, and wood like on the baseboards and doors')
print('I thought since my classes are all online that they wouldn't be able to eat my homework but I think they ate the _lab02_ part of this filename')
print('This is my way of telling you that my dogs ate part of my homework')
